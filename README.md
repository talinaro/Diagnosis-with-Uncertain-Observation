# Diagnosis-with-Uncertain-Observation

## Description
In anomaly detection, uncertainty over the observations can happen when a noisy sensor is used to collect the output.
We would like to take in consideration the fact that the observations can be mistaken with some probability in order to, hopefully, provide more accurate tand reliable fault diagnosis.


## Data
The data consists of `.txt` files of system descriptions and observations:
#### System:
// TODO
#### Observations:
// TODO


## Implementation
